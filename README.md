# `Hello` potential employer

This repo contains a collection of scripts I've written either for personal productivity or for my IT career.
- A few examples include:
  - `playlist importer.sh` which edits, converts, and imports android playlists into rhythmbox.
  - `scanner.ps1` which automates the scanning process in windows and converts result to pdf.
  - `slot machine.py` is a simple slot machine CLI game.

# About `me`

I was introduced to programming in college, but it wasn't until several years later that I actually dove deeper into it.

It all started when I switched from Windows to Linux and ran my first command:
```sh
echo "hello world"
```
I'm actually surprised that I never touched powershell when I was a Windows user. Ironically, Linux forced me to get comfortable with the command line because I was always running into issues with my particular setup.

Once I was had a handle on it, I decided to switch back to Windows and give powershell a go. From there, python was a no brainer given its ubiquity in the industry.

I'm not a software developer by any means, but I've learned enough to make my life easier.
