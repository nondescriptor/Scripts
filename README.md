# `Hello`, future employer!

This repo contains some of the scripts I've written for my IT career, productivity, and fun.
- A few examples include the following:
  - `salt.py` encrypts and decrypts text files.
  - `playlist importer.sh` edits, converts, and imports android playlists into rhythmbox.
  - `scanner.ps1` automates the scanning process in Windows and converts result to a pdf.

Most of them are user-specific, but salt.py and slot machine.py can be run on any machine.

# About `me`

I was introduced to programming in college, but it wasn't until after I graduated that I actually dove deeper into it.

It all started when I switched from Windows to Linux and ran my first command:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
I'm actually surprised that I never touched PowerShell when I was a Windows user. Ironically, Linux forced me to get comfortable with the command line because I was always running into issues with my particular setup.

Once I was comfortable writing Bash scripts, I decided to give PowerShell a go. From there, Python was the logical next choice given its ubiquity and demand in the industry.
