# About `me`

I was introduced to programming in college, but it wasn't until several years later that I actually dove deeper into it.

It all started when I switched from Windows to Linux and ran my first command:
```sh
echo "hello world"
```
I'm actually surprised myself that I never touched powershell when I was a Windows user. Ironically, Linux forced me to get comfortable with the command line because I was always running into issues with my particular setup.

Once I was had a handle on it, I realized I could probably do everything I did in Linux with powershell in Windows, so I switched back and gave powershell a go. From there, given python's ubiquity, I knew I was going to have to dip my toes in it sonner or later, so I chose the former.

I'm not a software developer by any means, but I've learned enough to make my life easier.
