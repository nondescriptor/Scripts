# About `me`

I was introduced to programming in college, but it wasn't until several years later that I actually dove deeper into it.

It all started when I switched from Windows to Linux and ran my first command:
```sh
echo "hello world"
```
I'm actually surprised that I never touched powershell when I was a Windows user. Ironically, Linux forced me to get comfortable with the command line because I was always running into issues with my particular setup.

Once I had a handle on it, I decided to switch back to Windows and give PowerShell a go. From there, python was a no brainer given its ubiquity in the industry.
