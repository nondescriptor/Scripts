# `Hello` potential employer

This repo contains a collection of scripts I've written either for personal productivity or for my IT career.
- A few examples include:
  - `salt.py` encrypts and decrypts text files.
  - `playlist importer.sh` edits, converts, and imports android playlists into rhythmbox.
  - `scanner.ps1` automates the scanning process in Windows and converts result to a pdf.

# About `me`

I was introduced to programming in college, but it wasn't until after I graduated that I actually dove deeper into it.

It all started when I switched from Windows to Linux and ran my first command:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
I'm actually surprised that I never touched PowerShell when I was a Windows user. Ironically, Linux forced me to get comfortable with the command line because I was always running into issues with my particular setup.

Once I was comfortable writing bash scripts, I decided to give PowerShell a go. From there, python was the logical next choice given its ubiquity and demand in the industry.
